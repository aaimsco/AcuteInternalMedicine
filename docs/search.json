      "contents": "\nToo few beds, poor access to investigations, and lack of community support to unblock beds were reasons identified in the UK as top problems in the hospital admission process.\nThe Royal College of Physicians (RCP) defined acute medical units (AMUs) as ‘a dedicated facility within a hospital that acts as the focus for acute medical care for patients who have presented as medical emergencies to hospital’. In the UK, AMUs are the base for the practise of acute internal medicine (AIM), and have become integral to the care pathway of most patients who require hospital-based acute medical care in the UK.\nA recent systematic review of 17 studies of 12 acute medical units (AMUs) across 5 countries established the clear effectiveness of acute medical units in reducing the length of stay (LOS), and less convincingly, mortality rates. Hospital LOS was the outcome of interest in 18 analyses across 12 studies totalling 315 000 patients/episodes. All reported a reduction in LOS in the AMU group when compared to the non-AMU group. For those which reported mean LOS for the two groups, the magnitude of reduction ranged from 0.3 to 2.62 days. Mortality was the outcome of interest in 14 analyses across eight studies totalling 890,000 patients/episodes measured at varying time points (in-hospital, 30 days post-admission, 30 days post-discharge, 1 year). A reduced mortality rate was found in the AMU group in comparison to the non-AMU group in 12 of the 14 analyses. Five of these 12 analyses reported this decrease as being statistically significant.\nOne study that used logistic regression to adjust for confounders, which include comorbidities, illness severity score and disease category, reported a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality in the AMU group compared to the non-AMU group (adjusted odds ratio = 0.28, 95% CI 0.23– 0.35).\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nLike established subspecialties palliative care, geriatrics, oncology, and intensive care, to name but a few, Acute Internal Medicine has a functional basis rather than organ based.\nAcute internal medicine is a model of care in which patients with acute medical illness are provided with the best quality care, in the right environment, with assessment, diagnosis and treatment as actively managed components of that care.\nThe key features of AIM are:\nclinical service delivered by acute physicians within the AMU environments for at least 12 hours per day and seven days per week\nmedical leadership within an AMU in a service designed and managed by acute physicians who specialise in AIM\nservice delivered by an AIM physician and dedicated multidisciplinary team with timely and appropriate interaction with other specialties\nservice design informed by quality standards\nperformance benchmarked against key clinical quality indicators for AMU.\nThe objectives of AIM are:\nTo provide immediate and effective patient-centered care to the acute and complex undifferentiated cases, with timely and appropriate interaction with other specialties.\nTo provide high standard specialist care to the acute and complex undifferentiated cases, both at the earliest presentation to the hospital and in the critical care settings.\nTo enhance and strengthen the provision of care in a multidisciplinary team approach, preventing fragmentation of patient care.\nTo be the backbone in the provision of quality specialist care to the general medical patients.\nRole of AIM physician\nPre admission:\nAIM physician working in M.A.U, Emergency department, Daycare, and specialist clinic\n\nAcute care:\nAIM physician working in critical care areas, i.e HDW, CCU, CRW\n\nAdvanced care:\nAIM physician working in general medical wards\n\nThere are 3 main components to the services provided by the AIM physician:\nInpatient services\nOutpatient services\nReferral services\nInpatient Services\nCritical Care Units (CCU/CRW/HDW)\nMedical Admissions Unit (MAU)\nMedical Admissions Unit (MAU)\nMAU provides service to the short stay patients within the department of medicine, with expected length of stay of 24-72 hours.\nObjectives:\n\nTo provide safe and effective immediate care to medical patients, within the first 24-72 hours of presentation.\n\n\nTo reduce patient length of stay by utilizing appropriate alternative pathways to deliver high standards of care (i.e FAST clinic).\n\nStructure:\nThe MAU ward is headed by the Acute Internal Medicine consultants, assisted by an MAU ward Manager, ideally a nursing sister trained or experienced in acute medical care. The ward is preferably located near the emergency department with easy access to support services frequently required by the patients admitted to the unit, such as radiology services, laboratory, endoscopy unit, operation theater and others. The bed strength of an MAU will be dependent on the needs of the hospital, and may be a flexi/mixed gender ward (male & female). Being an admissions unit, MAU shall have a close working relationship with the hospital bed manager.\nOutpatient Services\nFast Clinic (Rapid Review Clinic)\nObjectives:\n\nTo provide high quality rapid access to outpatient services for patients presenting to the emergency department, not requiring admission but require early outpatient review and treatment.\n\n\nTo improve utilisation of acute medical beds by providing early continuity of care as outpatient, for discharged medical patients.\n\n\nTo provide efficient outpatient care for treatment/procedures that would have otherwise been performed as inpatient, i.e daily outpatient IV therapy etc.\n\nStructure\nThe clinic is under the direct supervision of the Acute Internal Medicine consultant and assisted by an MAU Clinic Manager, ideally a nursing sister trained or experienced in acute medical care. A Staff Nurse shall be in charge of arranging patient appointments and outpatient care plans. Staff strength will depend on patient volume and complexity of cases. The clinic shall operate during office hours of 08:00 to 17:00, Mondays to Fridays.

In other words, have we managed to bend the epidemic curve away from its natural trajectory? If so, are we good curve-benders?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Click on the chart to engage its interactive mode. RED projected natural trajectory, BLUE smoothened epidemic curve, BLACK DASHED actual epidemic curve. Smoothened epidemic curve contains incidence in log values.\n\n\n\nThe chart above confirms that we are curve-benders! The actual curve has separated from the projected natural trajectory by a large margin. All well and good, but we need to assess how good the curve-bending has been. For that, we need to gage the daily effective reproduction numbers.\n\nSource: https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-last-airbender-2010\nDaily \\(R_e\\)\n\\(R_e\\) is the reproduction number calculated at different time points during the epidemic, i.e. the average number of expected infected persons by a primary case in a population of susceptibles and infected individuals.\nThe estimation of \\(R_e\\) requires knowing the serial interval. The serial interval is the time elapsed between the symptom onset of the primary case and the date of symptom onset of the secondary case. Here we used the estimated serial interval by Zhanwei et al (2020), with a mean of 3.96 days and a standard deviation 4.75 days (Zhanwei et al 2020). In this analyses, \\(R_e\\) was estimated in a sliding window of 7-days. The method applied here is based on Wallinga and Teunis (2004). Estimates of \\(R_e\\) were carried out in R v3.6.2, R-package EpiEstim v2.2-1. The code for plotting and calculating \\(R_e\\) based on Churches (2020).\nThe model was also adjusted for uncertainty in the serial interval assumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Click on the chart to engage its interactive mode. Ribbon 95% CI of the mean \\(R_e\\).\n\n\n\nIt appears that by March 22, four days after the commencement of the Movement Control Order instituted by the Government of Malaysia, the mean \\(R_e\\) was down to 1.26, a remarkable drop from the peak mean \\(R_e\\) of 3.09 on March 15.\nHowever, the latter part of the \\(R_e\\) curve has risen to more than 1 since May 23. While this rise may well be due to increased positive screens among foreigners held at a few immigration holding facilities throughout the country for various immigration offences; this is in turn part of the more proactive effort in case-finding by the Ministry of Health of Malaysia. Malaysians must not be complacent.\nSource code\nAvailable at https://github.com/aaimsco/rpubs\nFull article\nAvailable at https://rpubs.com/saiful\n\n\n",

Source: Google Images\nServices\nAIM HSAH started its service in 2018 and focuses on two main areas: Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) in managing acutely ill medical patients and managing acute stroke.\nPoint of Care Ultrasound (POCUS)\nPoint-of-care ultrasound is performed by clinicians trained in ultrasound with focused clinical questions. As the name implied, POCUS is used at the bedside with the following functional clinical intents:\nDiagnostic:\nPOCUS is emergent diagnostic imaging to diagnose disease either based on symptoms or signs by utilising specific clinical pathway (e.g. shortness of breath, chest pain, lower limb swelling)\nUsually, patients present to the clinician with an undifferentiated clinical presentation, for example, breathlessness; by utilising POCUS, clinicians can differentiate and increase the certainty of diagnosis that’s not able to be differentiated by the history and physical examination alone. The management of that particular patient may be planned accurately.\nTherapeutic and Monitoring:\nUsing POCUS to locate the area for therapeutic management, e.g. peritoneal tapping and pleural tapping avoids many undue complications resulting from a blind procedure.\nUsing POCUS to monitor patient condition or the effects of specific management promptly saves lives and resources; e.g. using POCUS after fluid resuscitation in dengue shock syndrome or monitoring fluid responsiveness in a patient with septicaemia shock.\nProcedure Guidance:\nPOCUS is used as an aid to guide a procedure such as central line insertion or arterial line insertion. Hence the chances of getting it right on the first attempt are higher.\nResuscitative:\nPOCUS may be used in acute resuscitation, especially when findings the reversibility of cardiac arrest, e.g. in diagnosing massive pericardial effusion and tension pneumothorax. Visualising cardiac contractility during resuscitation also enables more effective resuscitation.\nHence, an AIM physician with these niche skills can optimise the care of a patient and the usage of resources.\nManagement of Acute Stroke\nStroke and the morbidity related to stroke are well established. It is also one of the most significant contributors to mortality in Malaysia. Management of stroke includes management of hyperacute stroke and acute stroke.\nGraph below shows total admission of patient admitted for stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n AIM Unit in HSAH has an interest in looking after this set of patients to improve the mortality and morbidity outcomes. The collaboration with Malaysian Stroke Council enables the initiation of Hyperacute Stroke Management and Acute Stroke Thrombolysis in HSAH. The collaboration includes training clinicians, exchanging resources (Alteplase on an exchange basis) and developing the network of tertiary stroke care. The HSAH hyperacute stroke thrombolysis care was developed following the Malaysian Stroke Council and international standards.\nThroughout the service since September 2019, during office hours, hyperacute stroke protocol was activated for 118 cases, and 23 cases had thrombolysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A few parameters were analysed, including the onset of symptoms, Door-to-CT scan time and Door-to-Needle time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We had a reasonable outcome with median Door-to-CT of 17 minutes (target 25 minutes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n and median Door-to-Needle of 80 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Zainura Che Isa is an AIM Physician in a major regional hospital.

      "contents": "\nWhat is Acute Internal Medicine?\nAcute Internal Medicine is the field of practice within Internal Medicine that provides assessment and treatment for adult patients with medical conditions when they are first admitted to hospital. This usually involves the first 24-72 hours of admission to hospital. The field also provides management of patients who deteriorate acutely during hospital stay.\nThe History | Origin | Other Countries\nIn the United Kingdom, it is defined as,‘that part of general internal medicine (GIM) concerned with the immediate and early specialist management of adult patients suffering from a wide range of medical conditions who present to, or from within, hospitals, requiring urgent or emergency care’.\nIts adoption has been justified in view of two needs: the need of patients to receive expert acute care and the need of hospitals to deliver a service on limited resources with greater efficiency and coordination.\nThe tensions between increased specialisation and the need to retain high quality general medical skills to manage the emergency workload are well recognised. The creation of specialties within medicine have raised concerns about the ability of specialists in one specialty to deliver the best care to patients suffering from the acute disorders of another specialty. Different hospitals will have consultant staff in both emergency and general medicine who have differing ambitions and varying enthusiasm for the early management of ill patients.\nIn the early 1990s it was recognised that the established model of medical patients being admitted from the emergency department (ED) directly to a ward bed was unsustainable in the face of reduced bed capacity and increasing patient attendances/admissions. Alternative models of care were required. Acute medicine evolved to provide patients with acute medical illness with the best quality care, in the right environment, with assessment, diagnosis and treatment as actively managed components of that care. In 1996, the Royal College of Physicians of London (RCPL) reviewed different models of care and concluded that emergency care provided by specialist teams would only be possible in very large hospitals covering large populations. The report recommended that in the majority of hospitals, care would continue to be provided by consultant physicians with specialty training, who participated in the on-call rota for acute medicine and practised their specialty in parallel. Interestingly, an alternative possibility was outlined: ‘a new type of physician with specific responsibility for the care of medical emergencies’.\nIn 1998 the Scottish Intercollegiate Working Party outlined recommendations for ‘Acute medical admissions and the future of general medicine’. It suggested that large hospitals might consider appointing ‘physicians in acute care medicine’ and that the Colleges should consider setting up a working party to address career structures and training issues.\nLater, in 1999 the idea of Acute Internal Medicine specialty was conceived. Acute medicine thus emerged in the 1990s as a result of the NHS UK recognising the need to improve acute medical care. The recognition of acute medicine for subspecialty training by the Joint Committee for Higher Medical Training was established in July 2003.\nThe acute physician is someone who is comfortable dealing with complex, acutely deteriorating or critical patients and expediting rapid discharge across interfaces.\nA report of an RCP working party in 2004 recommended that the goal should be to provide at least three consultants in acute medicine in every acute trust by 2008, and more in larger hospitals. Larger trusts may eventually have 7–12 consultants in acute medicine.\nIn August 2009, acute internal medicine (AIM) was formally recognised as a specialty for medical training.\nOther countries are increasingly adopting this model of care, including Ireland, Australasia and other parts of Europe.\nIn 2015 there were 90 consultant appointments unfilled – 48% of those posts advertised. The Society for Acute Medicine UK monitors BMJ advertisements for consultants in AIM. Their data shows that from February to September 2016 there were 162 permanent AIM appointments. In 2015 there were 336 trainees in AIM in the UK. There are now over 450 consultants specialising in Acute Medicine across the UK and over 225 hospitals have an Acute Medical Unit (AMU).\n\n\n",

The skill domains are:\na procedural skill,\na defined special interest,\nmedical education and training,\na research area.\nTrainees are allowed to acquire multiple specialist skills from a combination of skill domains or focus on a particular domain. However, the minimum standard is that the trainee must acquire at least ONE specialist skill.\n\nEducational plan\nEvery trainee is advised to formulate an educational plan for the whole training programme with an educational supervisor and submitted to the Fellowship Training Board for Advanced Acute Internal Medicine for approval. The plan should include specific interests and skills to be covered in each module, intended exposure and experience to achieve competencies. Competencies to be achieved should be determined clearly. It is emphasised that the importance of quality of learning supersedes volume of patients seen and is reflected by the achievement of competencies regardless of time spent to achieve them.\nIn order to achieve optimal learning, the scheduling of an educational plan should be flexible and suited to the mature learner. Modules may run concurrently, for example, diagnostic imaging and cardiology, and research and infectious disease. It is emphasised that the successful completion of a module depends on the achievement of competencies determined for that module in an educational plan. Upon achievement of a specialist skill, the trainee is advised to formulate with the educational supervisor a plan of maintenance of competencies.\n\nDuration of training\nThe recommended duration of training in the respective sub-specialities and specialist skill areas of training which trainees in Acute Internal Medicine will have to undertake is as below:\n\n\nTable 1: Training modules and duration.\n\n\nModule\n\n\nDuration\n\n\nCardiology\n\n\n12 weeks\n\n\nRespiratory medicine\n\n\n12 weeks\n\n\nGastroenterology & hepatology\n\n\n12 weeks\n\n\nNephrology\n\n\n12 weeks\n\n\nNeurology\n\n\n12 weeks\n\n\nInfectious diseases\n\n\n12 weeks\n\n\nCritical care\n\n\n12 weeks\n\n\nCare of the elderly\n\n\n12 weeks\n\n\nDiagnostic imaging\n\n\n12 weeks\n\n\nEndocrinology\n\n\n4 weeks\n\n\nRheumatology\n\n\n4 weeks\n\n\nAdvanced specialist skill(s) development\n\n\n40 weeks\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n156 weeks (36 months)\n\n\nThe training duration in a particular module may be shortened if the trainee satisfies training requirements as laid out in an educational plan. If a particular module is shorter, the excess time may be added into another module or into advanced specialist skill(s) development, with the approval of the educational supervisor. The total duration of training must be 156 weeks (36 months).\nThe advanced specialist skill(s) development period is the time when the trainee develops advanced specialist skills in at least one particular domain as mentioned above. This period of training may also include overseas training in a field of interest, community medicine and public health attachment, and/or used for a period of maintenance of acquired procedural skills. This forty-eight weeks period may be spread over the entire duration of training if deemed necessary and appropriate by the Fellowship Training Board.\n\nTraining Centre.\nIn order that the trainee obtains adequate exposure, only hospitals that have an adequate case mix will be considered to be accredited as a Training Centre. The criteria include:\nWorkload and Physical structure:\nThe training hospital must have a daily admission of not less than thirty (30) new unselected cases each day to the General Medical wards.\nThere should be a minimum of 6 beds which are designated for the care of acutely ill medical patients and these beds must be equipped with appropriate monitoring equipment.\nThe trainee will need to be involved in the follow-up management of these patients following discharge where applicable.\nTrainers & Educational Supervisors:\nThe trainer must have a minimum of 2 years post-subspecialty gazettement experience or 7 years post-internal medicine gazettement experience in the management of unselected acutely ill medical patients including the management of such patients once their condition has stabilised.\nThe educational supervisor must be an Acute Internal Medicine physician with at least 2 years post-AIM gazettement experience and will be assigned by the Fellowship Training Board for Acute Internal Medicine. The trainer to trainee ratio is 1:2.\nThe educational plan must include intended institutions of training in each module.\nAIM trainees will be gazetted physicians who would have been privileged and credentialed to perform the procedures covered in this fellowship programme. In selected modules where the trainee has to perform a specified number of procedures or conduct clinic sessions, these procedures and clinic sessions may be arranged over the 3 year period for maintenance of competencies especially in the domain of procedural skills.\n\nAssessment methods\nDuring each module:\nLogbook for core procedures\nWorkplace-based assessment\nNarrative report by the supervisor\nExit viva is scheduled on completion of full training.\n\n\n",

This can be measured by the basic reproduction number, \\(R_0\\). The basic reproduction number (\\(R_0\\)) is the reproduction number when there is no immunity from past exposures or vaccination, nor any deliberate intervention in disease transmission. Estimation of \\(R_0\\) may be based on the exponential growth slope of an epidemic curve. To do so, we assume exponentially distributed latent and infectious period of a SEIR model, and the following assumptions:\nlatency estimate: 3 days\nsymptomatic viral shedding estimate: 8 days\nserial interval estimate: mean 3.96 days, SD 4.75 days.\nBelow is the epidemic curve for Malaysia:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Click on the chart to engage its interactive mode\n\n\n\nPeak\nTo identify the growth phase (and the decay phase of the curve), the peak of the curve must be identified.

In comparison, the official declared value was 3.5, which was based on contact tracing averaging. It appears that empirical individual patient data is consistent with population level data; however, we will confirm it with further assessment.\n\\(R_0\\) from earlyR package\nA Bayesian framework for estimating \\(R_0\\) using population level data is available with the EpiEstim R package. The package has been later supplemented with a simpler version, the earlyR R package. Below are the \\(R_0\\) estimates of that Bayesian model.\n\n\n\n\\(R_0\\) 95% CI\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.
