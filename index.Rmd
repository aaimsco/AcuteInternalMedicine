Acute Internal Medicine is the field of practice within Internal Medicine that provides assessment and treatment for adult patients with medical conditions when they are first admitted to hospital. 

Its adoption has been justified in view of two needs: the need of patients to receive expert acute care and the need of hospitals to deliver a service on limited resources with greater efficiency and co-ordination.

The tensions between increased specialisation and the need to retain high quality general medical skills to manage the emergency workload are well recognised [1](https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmedicine.4-3-203). 

The creation of specialties within medicine have raised concerns about the ability of specialists in one specialty to deliver the best care to patients suffering from the acute disorders of another specialty. Different hospitals will have consultant staff in both emergency and general medicine who have differing ambitions and enthusiasms for the early management of ill patients [2](https://emj.bmj.com/content/21/6/652).

In the UK, the idea of Acute Internal Medicine specialty was conceived in 1999. The recognition of acute medicine for subspecialty training by the Joint Committee for Higher Medical Training was established in July 2003.
