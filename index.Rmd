Acute Internal Medicine is the field of practice within Internal Medicine that provides assessment and treatment for adult patients with medical conditions when they are first admitted to hospital. 

Its adoption has been justified in view of two needs: the need of patients to receive expert acute care and the need of hospitals to deliver a service on limited resources with greater efficiency and co-ordination.
